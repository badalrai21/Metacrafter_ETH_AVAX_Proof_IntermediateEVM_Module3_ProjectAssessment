# BadalToken exchanging by ERC20 Token
# Metacrafter_ETH_AVAX_Proof_IntermediateEVM_Module3_ProjectAssessment

BadalToken is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to facilitate token ```minting```, ```burning```, and ```transferring```. This smart contract is developed using Solidity and leverages the ```OpenZeppelin``` library to ensure security and best practices. The contract owner has the exclusive ability to ```mint``` new tokens, while all users can ```burn``` and ```transfer``` their tokens.


## Description
BadalToken is a custom ERC20 token built with Solidity and leveraging OpenZeppelin's secure implementation. It supports essential functionalities such as minting, burning, and transferring tokens. The contract ensures that only the owner can mint new tokens, while all users can burn and transfer their tokens securely. This token is designed to provide robust and efficient token management on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features
#^ Minting Tokens: The contract owner has the authority to mint new tokens and assign them to any specified address. This functionality is critical for controlling the initial and subsequent distribution of tokens.
Burning Tokens: Users can reduce the circulating supply by burning their tokens. This is useful for token management and maintaining value by controlling the total supply.
Transferring Tokens: Users can securely transfer tokens to other addresses, ensuring smooth and efficient token transactions within the ecosystem.

## Getting Started
### Executing the Program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) (https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Hotel.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

contract Hotel {
    address public owner;
    uint256 public roomCount;

    struct Room {
        uint256 id;
        string name;
        uint256 price;
        bool isAvailable;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Room) public rooms;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can perform this action");
        _;
    }

    event RoomAdded(uint256 id, string name, uint256 price);
    event RoomUpdated(uint256 id, string name, uint256 price, bool isAvailable);

    function addRoom(uint256 _id, string memory _name, uint256 _price) public onlyOwner {
        require(_price > 0, "Price must be greater than zero");

        rooms[_id] = Room(_id, _name, _price, true);
        roomCount++;

        emit RoomAdded(_id, _name, _price);
    }

    function updateRoom(uint256 _id, string memory _name, uint256 _price, bool _isAvailable) public onlyOwner {
        require(_price > 0, "Price must be greater than zero");

        Room storage room = rooms[_id];
        if (bytes(room.name).length == 0) {
            revert("Room does not exist");
        }

        room.name = _name;
        room.price = _price;
        room.isAvailable = _isAvailable;

        emit RoomUpdated(_id, _name, _price, _isAvailable);
    }

    function getRoom(uint256 _id) public view returns (string memory, uint256, bool) {
        Room storage room = rooms[_id];
        require(bytes(room.name).length > 0, "Room does not exist");
        return (room.name, room.price, room.isAvailable);
    }

    function totalRooms() public view returns (uint256) {
        assert(roomCount >= 0);
        return roomCount;
    }
}

```

## Compiling the Code
➛ Open the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.  
➛ Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version).  
➛ Click the "Compile Hotel.sol" button.   

## Deploying the Contract
➛ Open the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.  
➛ Select the "Hotel" contract from the dropdown menu.  
➛ Click the "Deploy" button.  

### Interacting with the Contract
#### 1. Add a Room:

➝ Expand the addRoom function in the deployed contract section.  
➝ Enter the parameters: _id, _name, _price.  
➝ Click transact to add the room.  

#### 2. Update a Room:

➝ Expand the updateRoom function in the deployed contract section.  
➝ Enter the parameters: _id, _name, _price, _isAvailable.  
➝ Click transact to update the room.  

#### 3. View a Room:

➝ Expand the getRoom function in the deployed contract section.  
➝ Enter the _id of the room you want to view.  
➝ Click call to view the room details.  

#### 4. Get Total Rooms:

➝ Expand the totalRooms function in the deployed contract section.  
➝ Click call to view the total number of rooms.  

## Help
If you encounter any issues or have questions about this project, there are several resources available to assist you:

### Documentation
Solidity Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for the Solidity programming language, including syntax and features. Visit Solidity Documentation.
Remix Documentation: Learn how to use Remix, the online Solidity IDE, with detailed guides and examples. Visit Remix Documentation.  
##### Common Issues
##### 1. Insufficient Gas:

➝ Ensure you have enough Ether in your account to cover the transaction gas fees.  
➝ Try increasing the gas limit for your transaction.  
##### 2. Compiler Errors:

➝ Verify that you are using a compatible Solidity compiler version (e.g., 0.8.26).  
➝ Double-check your contract code for syntax errors.  
##### 3. Deployment Issues:

➝ Make sure you are connected to the correct Ethereum network (e.g., Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby).  
➝ Ensure your Ethereum wallet is unlocked and has sufficient funds.  

### FAQs
Q: How do I add a new room?  
A: Use the addRoom function with the required parameters: _id, _name, and _price. Ensure the _price is greater than zero.

Q: How do I update a room?  
A: Use the updateRoom function with the room's _id, new _name, new _price, and _isAvailable status. Ensure the room exists before updating.

Q: How do I check the total number of rooms?  
A: Use the totalRooms function to get the current count of rooms.
